Neighborly is a dynamic web application that encourages relationships between neighbors. By geo-targeting local and private communities, Neighborly provides an outlet to express personal and familial needs such as shoveling a driveway, getting a babysitter, getting your kids a ride to hockey practice, finding orders for girl scout cookies, or even just letting the neighborhood know you're having a pool party next week. In the hectic world of today what we really need is to be Neighborly.
